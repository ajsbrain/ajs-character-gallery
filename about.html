  <h1>About This Website</h1>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9Z3X.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-3" style="max-width:300px;">
  <p>This website was created as a static fictional character gallery. I chose a mix of anime, superhero, and video game characters to make the site visually interesting and fun. The goal of this project was to practice HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript while building a functional prototype website.</p>
